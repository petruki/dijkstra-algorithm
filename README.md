### About

Famous algrithm by Edsger W. Dijkstra.

Algorithm well explained here:
[Graph Data Structure 4. Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVfj6mxhdMw)

This implementation offers a wide view of how the algorithm works.<br>
Based on behavior modeling, the implementation is modular enough to be viewed as granular version of the algorithm.
